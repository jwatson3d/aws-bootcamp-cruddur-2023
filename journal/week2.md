# Week 2 â€” Distributed Tracing

## Required Homework/Tasks

### Honeycomb Setup

I first tested backend from command line using

```python
export OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT="https://api.honeycomb.io/"
export OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_HEADERS="x-honeycomb-team=************"
export OTEL_SERVICE_NAME="cruddur"
python3 -m flask run --host=0.0.0.0 --port=4567
```

Here is the output after adding the console tracing exporter:

```json

        },
        "schema_url": ""
    }
}
127.0.0.1 - - [03/Mar/2023 10:06:41] "GET /api/activities/home HTTP/1.1" 200 -
```

I tend to prefer individual steps when doing CLI tasks so I manually ran the Docker build command again before starting the containers up. There were all kinds of errors and it took a minute to remember the code worked from the CLI so the code wasn't the problem. I then manually deleted the containers and images and built it again and it worked correctly.
